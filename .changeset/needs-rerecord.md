Add a per-line "needs re-record" flag (#227). `AuthoringFile.rerecord` (beat id -> true) marks a dialogue take that exists but must be redone; the new reserved `RERECORD_STATUS` masks the line's recording status everywhere it is read, so a "recorded" line still surfaces as work. `mergeAuthoring` now returns the `rerecord` set and ops exposes `effectiveRecording()`, which the recording script (`runVoiceScript`), the production report (`runReport`, with its own re-record bucket), and status browse (`runStatusBrowse`, filterable by `rerecord`) all resolve through. Authoring-only; never compiled into a bundle.
