Add `CastMember.gender` (a new `GrammaticalGender` type: `male` / `female` / `neuter`, absent = not specified) and carry it into the localisation handoff as translator context, so gendered languages can inflect a character's own lines: a `Gender` column in the Excel export, a `#. Gender: <g>` extracted comment in PO/POT, and `context.gender` on each JSON `LocEntry`. It is export-only (regenerated from the cast each export, never read back by `applyLoc`) and the compiler strips it from the runtime bundle alongside `notes`.
